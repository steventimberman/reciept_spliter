This is a small application that serves the purpose of dividing checks. With the popular use of venmo, never lose out on  a cent again! Currently, it runs locally (see below). with no database, it is for momentary use. All the info you need to input should be on your receipt, which are:

- subtotal: the total cost of the check before tax and tip
- total: the total cost of the check after tax and fees are added (but before tip)
- tip: the percent you want to tip (i.e. 20 correlates to 20% tip)
- item: the price of the item on the check that the person in question perchased (can input multiple)
